\title{Expoential detection function model}
\usage{
model.exponential(colname = "distance", truncation = NULL,
  constrained = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{colname}{Effort data column to use for the covariate extraction. Default: "distance"}

\item{truncation}{Distance to truncate at. Currently unused but passed on the the formula environment for later usage.}

\item{constrained}{If set to false a non-constrained linear effect is used for estimating the detection function. Handy for debugging.}
}
\value{
A \link{model}
}
\description{
Construct a model representing an exponential detection function.
}
\details{
The log-likelihood of this model is
\deqn{log p(z) = -0.5 * q * z}

with precision parameter q and distance z. Internally, it is represented by the \link{formula}

~ . + f(df.exp, model = 'clinear', range = c(0, Inf), hyper = list(beta = list(initial = 0, param = c(0,0.1))))

Hence, the effect is obtained from a contrained linear INLA model. The covariate "df.exp" for this model is as a 
function of the data.frame provided during the inference process:
 
 df.exp = function(X) { return(-X[,colname]) },
}
