\title{Models for \link{inlabru}}
\description{
As with most inference methods inlabru models are set up via model formulae.
However, inlabru supports a slightly more advanced syntax which separates the name of an
effect from the name of a covariate. For instance, a very simple formula that inlabru
can work with is
}
\details{
\code{y ~ myFixedEffect(temperature)}

which defines a latent effect named 'myFixedEffect' with 'tepmerature' as a multiplier.
Hence, except for explicitly giving a name to the effect, the above formula is equivalent
to

\code{y ~ temperature}

In fact, the latter will also work in inlabru but the name of the effect will be
'temperature'. The advantage of having an explicit name for the effect is that it 
allows for a more sophisticated syntax when making predictions.

In general, inlabru formula components are of the form

MyEffectName(map = aFunctionOfMyData, model = 'modelType', ...)

where

\itemize{
\item{\code{MyEffectName} is an aribtrary string defining the name of the effect}
\item{\code{map} can be 
(A) a name of a covariate, 
(B) a function's name that will be called with your data as a parameter
(C) an expression that is valid with your data as an environment}
\item{model} is one of the \link{inla.models}
\item{... are further arguments passed that inla \link{f} understands}
}

Internally, inlabru will construct a \code{model} form the formula that you define
using the \link{make.model} function. Useful operators on \code{model} objects are:

\itemize{
 \item{\link{summary}: }{ Summarize an \link{inlabru} model }
 \item{\link{labels}: }{ Character array of effect labels }
 \item{\link{effect}: }{ Retrieve one or more effects from a model }
 \item{\link{default}: }{ Default linear predictor expression }
 \item{\link{list.A}: }{ List A-matrices that will be constructed for the INLA stack }
 \item{\link{list.data}: }{ List environmental variables needed to call INLA}
 \item{\link{list.indices}: }{ List indices that will be constructed for the INLA stack}
 \item{\link{list.effects}: }{ List weights that will be constructed for the INLA stack}
 \item{\link{evaluate}: }{ Determine the linear predictor's value at some location }
 
}
