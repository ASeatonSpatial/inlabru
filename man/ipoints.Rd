\usage{
ipoints(samplers, config)
}
\arguments{
\item{samplers}{A Spatial[Points/Lines/Polygons]DataFrame objects}

\item{config}{An integration configuration. See \link{iconfig}}

\item{points}{A SpatialPoints[DataFrame] object}
}
\value{
Integration points
}
\description{
prerequisits:
}
\details{
- List of integration dimension names, extend and quadrature 
- Samplers: These may live in a subset of the dimensions, usually space and time 
            ("Where and wehen did a have a look at the point process")
- Actually this is a simplified view. Samplers should have start and end time !

Procedure:
- Select integration strategy by type of samplers: 
      1) SpatialPointsDataFrame: Assume these are already integration points
      2) SpatialLinesDataFrame: Use simplified integration along line with (width provided by samplers)
      3) SpatialPolygonDataFrame: Use full integration over polygons

- Create integration points from samplers. Do NOT perform simplification projection here!
- Simplify integration points. 
  1) Group by non-mesh dimensions, e.g. time, weather
  2) For each group simplify with respect to mesh-dimensions, e.g. space
  3) Merge
  
  Dependencies (iDistance):
  int.points(), int.polygon(), int.1d(), int.expand(), recurse.rbind()
