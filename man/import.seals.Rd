\title{Load seal data  
Turn seal data into spatial object
To avoid confusion I remove the x-y coordinates created by Martin
Change CRS
Select a strip
Add total number of seals
Build a mesh. This mesh will be fine at the photo locations but coarse elsewhere
Let's plot the observed counts
Ice Covariate
Interpolate ice covariate
Add band1 covariate to seals data frame
Plot seal count and ice together
Create a data set}
