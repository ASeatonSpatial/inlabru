\title{Sample from a log Gaussian Cox process (LGCP)}
\usage{
sample.lgcp(mesh, loglambda, strategy = "rectangle", R = 6371,
  samplers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{An \link{inla.mesh} object}

\item{loglambda}{A vector of log intensities at the mesh vertices (for higher order basis functions, e.g. for \code{inla.mesh.1d} meshes, \code{loglambda} should be given as \code{mesh$m} basis function weights rather than the values at the \code{mesh$n} vertices)}

\item{strategy}{Only applicable to 2D meshes. Use "rectangle" for flat 2D meshes and "spherical" for "sliced-spherical" for spherical meshes.}

\item{R}{Only for spherical meshes. This sets the radius of the sphere approximated by the mesh.}

\item{samplers}{A SpatialPolygonsDataFrame. Simulated points that fall outside these polygons are discarded.}
}
\value{
point samples on the mesh
}
