\title{Half-normal detection function model}
\usage{
model.halfnormal(data = NULL, truncation = NULL, constrained = TRUE,
  colname = "distance", effect = "nhsd")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\link{dsdata} data set. Used to determine distance truncation (if not provided)}

\item{truncation}{Distance to truncate at. Currently unused but passed on the the formula environment for later usage.}

\item{constrained}{If set to false a non-constrained linear effect is used for estimating the detection function. Handy for debugging.}

\item{colname}{Effort data column to use for the covariate extraction. Default: "distance"}

\item{effect}{Character setting the name of the effect in the model. Default: "nhsd" ("negative half squared distance")}
}
\description{
Construct a half-normal detection function model using the formula
}
\details{
~ . + f(nhsd, model = 'clinear', range = c(0, Inf), hyper = list(beta = list(initial = 0, param = c(0,0.1))))

Hence, the effect is obtained from a contrained linear INLA model. The covariate "nhsd" for this model is as a
function of the data.frame provided during the inference process:

nhsd = function(X) { return(-0.5*X[,colname]^2) },

that is, nhsd is half of the negative squared distance of an observation/integration point.
