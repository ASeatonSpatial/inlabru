\usage{
int.quadrature(sp = NULL, ep = NULL, scheme = "gaussian", n.points = 1,
  geometry = "euc", coords = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sp}{Start points of lines}

\item{ep}{End points of lines}

\item{scheme}{Integration scheme (gaussian or equdistant)}

\item{n}{Number of integration points}
}
\value{
List with integration poins (ips), weights (w) and weights including line length (wl)
}
\description{
Contruct integration points for each of lines defined by the start and end points provided.
The following schemes are available: 
"equidistant" : Equidistant integration points without boundary. All weights are identical and sum uf to the length of a line.
"gaussian": Points and weight according to the Gaussian quadrature rule. Currently only n=1 and n=2 are supported (Exact integration for linear and quadratic functions).
"twosided-gaussian": Experimental
