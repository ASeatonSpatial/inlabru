\usage{
predict.lgcp(result, predictor, points = NULL, integrate = NULL,
  samplers = NULL, property = "sample", n = 250, dens = NULL,
  discrete = FALSE, mcerr = 0.01, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{An lgcp object obtained by calling lgcp()}

\item{predictor}{A formula defining what to predict. The left hand side defines the dimension to predict over. The right hand side ought to be an expression that is evaluated for a given sample of the LGCP.}

\item{points}{Locations at which to predict. If NULL, the integration points of the LGCP are used}

\item{integrate}{A character array defining the dimensions to integrate the predicted expression over (e.g. "coordinates")}

\item{samplers}{A data.frame or Spatial* object that defines subsets of the dimensions to integrate over.}

\item{property}{By default ("sample") predictions are made using samples from the LGCP posterior. For debugging purposes this can also be set to the usual INLA summary statistics, i.e. "mean", "mode", "median", "sd" etc.}

\item{n}{Number of samples used to compute the predictor's statistics. The default is a rather low number, chose more for higher precision.}

\item{dens}{An expression defining an element of a micture density to be computed based on the samples generated by \code{predict}}

\item{discrete}{Set this to TRUE if \code{dens} is only defined for integer values}

\item{mcerr}{Monte Carlo error at which the sampling chain is stopped}

\description{
Takes a fitted LGCP produced by \link{lgcp} and predicts the expression stated by the right hand side of \code{predictor} for
a given set of \code{points}. A typical task is to predict values of the model for a sequence of points with consecutive values x_i, 
where x is one of the dimensions that the LGCP lives in. For convenience, this can be done automatically by leaving 
\code{points} set to \code{NULL} and stating a left hand side of the \code{predictor} formula, e.g. \code{x ~ f(x)}. The values
x_i for which the right hand side is evaluated are then either taken from the predictor's environment or, if not present, from
the integration points of the LGCP. If not points are provided and the right hand side is empty as well, \code{predict} assumes
that the predicted expression will evaluate so a single values for which the summary statistics are computed. Otherwise the
summary statistics are computed for each of the x_i.
}
\details{
A common task is to look at statistics that result from integrating the 
right hand side expression over one or more dimensions, say y and z. This can be achieved by setting the \code{integrate}
parameter. The summary statistics are then computed for the values resulting from the integration. If only a subset of
the space should be integrated over the \code{samplers} argument can be used. Usually this is a Spatial* object (see \link{sp}).
