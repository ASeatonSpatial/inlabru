\format{The data are a list that contains these elements:
 \describe{
   \item{\code{gnests}:}{ A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} object containing the locations of 
   the gorilla nests.}
   \item{\code{gnestboundary}:}{ An \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} object defining the boundary
   of the region that was searched for the nests.}
   \item{\code{gnestmesh}:}{ An \code{inla.mesh} object containing a mesh that can be used
   with function \code{lgcp} to fit a LGCP to the nest data.}
   \item{\code{gcov}:}{ A list of raster objects, one for each of these spatial covariates:
    \describe{
      \item{\code{aspect}}{ Compass direction of the terrain slope. Categorical, with levels 
      N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W and NW, which are coded as integers 1 to 8.}
      \item{\code{elevation}}{ Digital elevation of terrain, in metres.}
      \item{\code{heat}}{ Heat Load Index at each point on the surface (Beer's aspect), 
      discretised. Categorical with values Warmest (Beer's aspect between 0 and 0.999), 
      Moderate (Beer's aspect between 1 and 1.999), Coolest (Beer's aspect equals 2). These are
      coded as integers 1, 2 and 3, in that order.}
      \item{\code{slopangle}}{ Terrain slope, in degrees.}
      \item{\code{slopetype}}{ Type of slope. Categorical, with values Valley, Toe (toe slope), 
      Flat, Midslope, Upper and Ridge. These are coded as integers 1 to 6.}
      \item{\code{vegetation}}{ Vegetation type: a categorical variable with 6 levels coded as
      integers 1 to 6 (in order of increasing expected habitat suitability)}
      \item{\code{waterdist}}{ Euclidean distance from nearest water body, in metres.}

   \item{\code{gnestsamples}}{ A list with elements \code{sample_9x9}, \code{sample_5x5}, 
   \code{sample_9x9_60pc}, \code{sample_5x5_60pc}, containing plot samples of gorilla nests, 
   sampling 9x9 and 5x5 plots over the region, with 100\% coverage and with 60\% coverage. Each 
   element of the list has these components:
   \describe{
     \item{\code{counts}}{ A data frame with elements \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{count}, 
     \code{exposure}, being the x- and y-coordinates of the centre of each plot, the count in each 
     plot and the area of each plot.}
     \item{\code{plots}}{ A \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} defining the individual plot boundaries.}
     \item{\code{dets}}{ A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} giving the locations of each detected nest.}
