\title{Log-concave detection function model}
\usage{
model.logconcave(colname = "distance", truncation = NULL, segments = 5,
  constrained = TRUE, linbasis = TRUE, quadbasis = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{colname}{Effort data column to use for the covariate extraction. Default: "distance"}

\item{truncation}{Maximum distance assumed to be observed..}

\item{segments}{Number of quadratic basis basis functions}

\item{linbasis}{Wether to use a linear basis function.
If set to FALSE this implies that that the detection function has zero derivative at the origin.}

\item{clinear}{If set to false, non-constrained linear INLA effects are used for this model.
This is handy for debugging but the detection function is not necessarily log-concave anymore.}
}
\description{
Constructs a log-concave detection function model with formula
}
\details{
~ . + f(linbasis, model = "clinear", ...)
     + f(basis_1, model = "clinear", ...)
     + ... + f(basis_K, model = "clinear", ...)

whare K is the number of segments the basis lives on.
