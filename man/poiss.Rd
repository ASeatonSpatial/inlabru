\title{Poisson regression using INLA}
\usage{
poiss(points, model = NULL, predictor = NULL, mesh = NULL,
  family = "poisson", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A data frame or SpatialPointsDataFrame object}

\item{model}{Typically a formula or a \link{model} describing the linear regression predictor. If NULL, an intercept and a spatial SPDE component are used}

\item{predictor}{If NULL, the linear combination defined by the model/formula is used as a predictor for the counts. If a (possibly non-linear) expression is provided the respective Taylor approximation is used as a predictor. Multiple runs if INLA are then required for a better approximation of the posterior.}

\item{mesh}{An inla.mesh object modelling s spatial domain. If NULL, the mesh is constructed from a non-convex hull of the points provided}
}
\value{
An \link{iinla} object
}
\description{
This function provides an easy-to-use interface to Poisson regression using INLA, in particular for spatial count data. 
The \code{points} parameter is used to provide the regression data, e.g. counts, exposures and covariates to regress on.
The \code{model} parameter, typically a \link{formula}, defines two aspects of the regression. On the left hand side
the (known) counts as well as the exposures are stated. The right hand side defines the log linear predictor of the 
regression. For non-linear regression the \code{predictor} parameter can be emplyed to override the linear structure
implied by the formula. Note that the \link{INLA} \code{family} argument can be overwritten and thereby other INLA 
likelihoods like the binomial and zero-inflated count models are accessible.
