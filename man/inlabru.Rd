\description{
inla bru facilitates Beyesian spatial modeling using integrated nested Laplace approximations. It
is heavily based on R-inla (\url{http://www.r-inla.org}) but adds additional modeling abilities.
Tutorials and more information can be found at \url{https://fbachl.github.io/inlabru/} and
soon also at \url{http://inlabru.r-inla.org/}.
