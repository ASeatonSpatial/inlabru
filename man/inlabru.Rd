\description{
Inference for spatial point process data that arise from surveys that do not necessarily 
detect all points generated by the process. This includes, but is not limeted to, data that arise 
from plot sampling surveys and distance sampling surveys.

\details{
inla bru facilitates Bayesian spatial modeling using integrated nested Laplace approximations. It
is heavily based on R-inla (\url{http://www.r-inla.org}) but adds additional modeling abilities.
